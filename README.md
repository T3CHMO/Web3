# Different WEB's #
* Web 1.0 readonly, static, few users, only some companies
* Web 2.0 social media, online shopping, web as we know it today in mainstream, controled by corporations
* Web 3.0 owned by users, decentralized with no intermediaries, new business models

# Decentralization #
* Think about your accounts, are you really own them?
* No single point of failure
* Cloud is only someone else computer, and it could be shutdown
* True ownership = not your key's not your crypto
* Asset could be taken anyware, this is true Metaverse

# World computer #

* Ethereum founded in 2016 
* Blockchain with not only payments, but with ability to execute code in decentralized way = Smart contract
* Ethereum is LEGO
* Enables to create dApps, Tokens, NFTs.
* After deployment code can't be changed

# Decentralization trilemma #
* New EVM forks are compromising on DECENTRALIZATION or SECURITY to gain speed.
* Ethereum is slow, and demant is huge -> High transaction fees
* Scailing blockchains using Layer 2 
* Ethereum currenty 4 TPS, using L2 we can scale to 10 000 TPS not compromising DECENTRALIZATION or SECURITY.
* L2 are posting cryptographic proofs to L1

# Proof of work vs proof of stake #
* Transaction needs to be mined or validated to be added to blockchain
* Difference between PoW and PoS
*  PoS will be shipped in 2022

# Wallets #

* Two types of accounts
  * Externaly owned account
  * Smart contract  
* Public key 0x8c70d45566F6786CEFCb15C9c9570407f826f5c9
* A private key is nothing else than 64 random hex characters, never share it! :)
* Not your key's not your crypto
*

# Transactions #
* Reading blockchains is free
* Writing to it requires fee
* Examine transactions on Etherscan https://etherscan.io/

# Smart contracts #

* Solidity is programming language for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
* Solidity code is compiled to bytecode which is deployed to network by transaction 
* Bytecode is running in EVM when transaction is mined/validated - only when changing state of blockchain
* Remix IDE https://remix-project.org/

# Architecture #
* Blockchain is a backend
* Frontent is using web3.js or ethers.js libraty to interact with backend

* IPFS - interplanetary file system
* Content-based storage instead of location-based
* File must be pinned
* Hash is generated during upload, file cant be changed
* Website can be hosted on IPFS

# DEFI #

* This is already happening, fintech are in the first line, but banks are following.
* DEFI is offering 11% on stablecoins, new strategies are being explored
* Not all users want to menage their private keys in proper way. Banks or fintechs will do that for them. 
* Other users can borrow your assests and pay interest to you. Without intermediaries.

# NFT's # 
* Overpriced jpegs
* True ownership of unique digital item
* Game items can be used in different games
* True metaverse
