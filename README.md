# Different WEB's #
* Web 1.0 readonly, static, few users, only some companies
* Web 2.0 social media, online shopping, web as we know it today in mainstream, controled by corporations

# Decentralization #
* Think about your accounts, are you really own them?
* No single point of failure
* Cloud is only someone else computer, and it could be shutdown
* True ownership = not your key's not your crypto
* Asset could be taken anyware, this is true Metaverse

* Blockchain with not only payments, but with ability to execute code in decentralized way = Smart contract
* Ethereum is LEGO
* Enables to create dApps, Tokens, NFTs.

* Public key 0x8c70d45566F6786CEFCb15C9c9570407f826f5c9
* A private key is nothing else than 64 random hex characters, never share it! :)
* Not your key's not your crypto

# Transactions #
* Reading blockchains is free
* Writing to it requires fee
* Examine transactions on Etherscan https://etherscan.io/

# Proof of work vs proof of stake #
* Transaction needs to be mined or validated to be added to blockchain
* Difference between PoW and PoS

# DEFI #

* This is already happening, fintech are in the first line, but banks are following.
* DEFI is offering 11% on stablecoins, but its not for all. Not all users want to menage their private keys in proper way. Banks will do that for them. 
* How that high interest is made? Is it scam?
* Other users can borrow your assests and pay interest to you.
